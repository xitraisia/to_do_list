# to_do_list

This is a simple web app that does exactly what the name says. It's a to do list. You can add, delete or even cross out what you have done so far.
The app is python and django, but required a facelift after I was unable to launch it on heroku. The app required an environment using pipenv, django
as the framework and a bootstrap template for design. The project is currently hosted on https://todo---list.herokuapp.com and is also on my webpage.
